# DockerGC
Running Grasscutter (*some anime game* server reimplementation) with Docker

## How to create a server:
- Install Docker+MongoDB
- Open Terminal and enter:
```html
docker run --rm -it -p 22102:22102/udp -v /${PWD}/resources:/Grasscutter/resources -p 443:443/tcp -p 80:80/tcp siakbary/dockergc:dev-1.4 -d '2.0.0.100:27017' -b 'localhost' -f 'yes'
```
- done ðŸ™‚

If you want a version without docker but it's complicated:
https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter

## How to connect:
- Before starting, open the game first and then logout if you have logged in before and then exit again or you don't need to.
- Install Fiddler then open Fiddler then click tools -> options -> HTTPS print "Capture HTTPS" and "Decrypt Https" then click the "Actions" section then click Trues Root then click yes if a popup appears.
- In Fiddler in "FiddlerScript" tab, copy script from https://pastebin.com/raw/rfhpS7U5 then click save.
- Type again "docker run --rm -it -p 22102:22102/udp -p 443:443/tcp -p 80:80/tcp siakbary/dockergc:1.0 -d '2.0.0.100:27017' -b 'localhost'".
- Then type "account create yuuki" if there is a new response open the game.
- Login with user yuuki then password random/whatever then login alreadyðŸ™‚

## Bro, I don't want to make a server, so can I just join to your server?
Yes, Simple way is to just change localhost in file in pastebin to address server you want to connect to.

## SERVER TESTING MODE
```sh
game.yuuki.me
```
This server is located in Germany so Asian players will get high ping, you can login with "user1-10" for example "user1", for user11-50 it will be created again when we get a more stable version or at least have a password feature so you now you can login without a password on the account, the account data will be reset when the datebase is reset/error and sometimes the server is automatically disconnected due to an error/bug/update.

# DockerGC
DockerGC is a container that runs [Grasscutter](https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter) (*some anime game* server reimplementation) with just a single command.<br>
[![dockeri.co](https://dockeri.co/image/siakbary/dockergc)](https://hub.docker.com/r/siakbary/dockergc)
## How to create a server:
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- Open Terminal and Enter:
```sh
# Network (just once)
docker network create gc
# Datebase (just once) (db:27017 change ip and port and delete this if you already have a database)
docker run --rm -it --network gc --name db -d mongo &
# Game server (just once download resources with -f 'yes' after that you can set -f 'no')
docker run --rm -it --network gc -v resources:/home/Grasscutter/resources -p 22102:22102/udp -p 443:443/tcp siakbary/dockergc:ubuntu-Patch-DEV-c116a58 -d 'mongodb://db:27017' -b 'localhost' -f 'yes'
```
or (if you have compose)
```sh
"docker compose up" or "docker-compose up"
```
- Then type "account create yourusername" if there is a new response open the game.
- Yay

## Bro, I don't want to make a server, so can I just join to your server?
Yes, Simple way is to just change localhost in file in [Grasscutter Proxy](https://gitlab.com/yukiz/grasscutter-proxy) to address server you want to connect to.<br>
For server list please join:<br>

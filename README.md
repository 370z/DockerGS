- In Fiddler in "FiddlerScript" tab, copy script from https://pastebin.com/raw/rfhpS7U5 then click save.
- Type again "docker run --rm -it -p 22102:22102/udp -p 443:443/tcp -p 80:80/tcp siakbary/dockergc:1.0 -d '2.0.0.100:27017' -b 'localhost'".
- Then type "account create yuuki" if there is a new response open the game.
- Login with user yuuki then password random/whatever then login alreadyðŸ™‚

## Bro, I don't want to make a server, so can I just join to your server?
Yes, Simple way is to just change localhost in file in pastebin to address server you want to connect to.

## SERVER TESTING MODE
```sh
Server IP:
game.yuuki.me

* In order to access the command, please contact me *
```
This server is located in Germany so Asian players will get high ping, you can login with "user1-10" for example "user1", for user11-50 it will be created again when we get a more stable version or at least have a password feature so you now you can login without a password on the account, the account data will be reset when the datebase is reset/error and sometimes the server is automatically disconnected due to an error/bug/update.

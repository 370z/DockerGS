# DockerGC
DockerGC is a container that run [Grasscutter](https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter) (**some anime game** server reimplementation) with just a single command.<br>
## How to connect to server
[Since I don't want to write same post, please visit this](https://game.yuuki.me/posts/how-connect)
## How to create a server:
### Docker Version
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) + ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) If you want to run outside container)
- Open Terminal and Enter:
```sh
# Datebase (just once) (use this if you don't have a database outside container or want to use between containers)
docker run --rm -it --name db_gc -p 2777:27017/tcp -d mongo &
# Game server (just once download resources with -f 'yes' after that you can set -f 'no') (remember replace 2.0.0.100 with your pc's ip and don't use "localhost" this is important)
docker run --rm -it --name dockergc -v resources:/home/Grasscutter/resources -p 22102:22102/udp -p 443:443/tcp siakbary/dockergc:alpine-Patch-2.8-Early -d 'mongodb://2.0.0.100:2777' -b '2.0.0.100' -g '2.0.0.100' -f 'yes'
```
or if you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/akbaryahya/DockerGC
cd DockerGC
# docker compose up  # windows
docker-compose up -d # linux
```
- Then type "account create yourusername" if there is a new response open the game.
- Yay

### What is "**Early**"?
I made Early to do some testing of a new feature that needs a big change so this makes it unstable so it's better to split it apart to keep it stable.

## How to build this? 
### Source code (Patch Version) is closed now because many are remove "source link" from their server, so at this time you can only do pull from Docker Image  or Jar File.
### Remember [Grasscutter](https://github.com/Melledy/Grasscutter) source code is still open, you can do your own custom server with your own hard work.
## Required
- [Java 17 JDK](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Lombok](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67899014/vs-code-did-not-recognize-lombok)

Clone this with
```sh
git clone https://github.com/akbaryahya/DockerGC
cd DockerGC
cd gc
